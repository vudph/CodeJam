The month has 30 days and there are three types of ticket:

1-day ticket, costs 2, valid for one day;
7-day ticket, costs 7, valid for seven consecutive days (e.g. if the first valid day is X, then the last valid day is X+6);
30-day ticket, costs 25, valid for all thirty days of the month.
You want to pay as little as possible.

You are given a sorted (in increasing order) array A of dates when you will be travelling. For example, given:

A[0] = 1
A[1] = 2
A[2] = 4
A[3] = 5
A[4] = 7
A[5] = 29
A[6] = 30

You can buy one 7-day ticket and two 1-day tickets. The two 1-day tickets should be used on days 29 and 30.
The 7-day ticket should be used on the first seven days of the month.
The total cost is 11 and there is no possible way of paying less.
